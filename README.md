# Garage Band with OOP

## Creating a Garage Band with Object Oriented Programming.
Object oriented programming is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints called **Classes**, which are used to create individual instances of **objects**.

## Lab requirements

- Creare a Band class --> made up of different kinds of musicians(Drummer, Guitarist, Bassist).

- Create a Musician class --> to handle common functionality which particular kinds of musicians will inherit.
